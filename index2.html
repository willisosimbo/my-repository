        <h1> How does writing a CSS differ from writing HTML</h1>
        <div class="myclass">
        <p> As we write css these are the types of questions we ask ourselves</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Should we layout the line in a single or double column  </li>
            <li>Should we use a different color for the font header </li>
            <li>How should the very same content appear in a desktop vs mobile device </li>
        </ul>
        <p> All this questions above deal with esthetic and function consideration</p>
        <p>Lets consider the types of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the order of items within s list matter? Should it be numbered?</li>
            <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
            <li>Is this the most important header in the HTML document</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last few questions deal with structure, hierachy and meaning. These are perspective of content layer in HTML</p>
        <p> When we write CSS we focus on esthetic and function consideration. When we write HTML we focus on structure,hierachy and meaning</p>
